debits,
one trans, subtract a value


budget
this is what we want to spend on what

savings
we have a goal
we have an end amt
we have an end date
we want to save so much a month
we have money come into our checking
or direct deposit into savings acct


i want to fully fund all savings goals for the month, expected
when I get money at the end of the month, I want to transfer to savings what I can actually save
when I 

could treat savings like a transfer

savings could be an account

the bank accounts don't really matter as much as the things we're saving for

convert accounts to goals

savings expected go negative
checking is general use / spending
transfer out of mach into savings goal
can monitor amts around a goal
can create milestones around a goal
can map a goal to a bank account, hopefully


start a new account means start a new goal

retire - job 1
retire - 


FLOW
make savings acct
make goal date, amt
derive monthly amt to meet goal
graph is a line graph that has solid lines for months with actuals, dotted for future expecteds
monthly budget - expected is derived monthly amt or other
when save, transfer the amt from general/checking
shows up as an actual in savings goal acct
buy a thing - actual against saving acct??
